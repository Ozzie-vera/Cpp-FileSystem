# Cpp-FileSystem
A Data Struct meant to emulate unix shell

This was done as a Data structure class project, in way is it suppose to be a functional C++ unix shell. 
Contains only some of the most common commands used in unix file systems

start the program and type help to find all the commands it includes.

I have left constructor and deconstructor messages, this was done to ensure no memory leaks were present in the program as per assignment rules.
